PlantDiseaseNet: Convolutional Neural Network Ensemble for  Plant Disease and Pest Detection

Plant diseases and pests cause significant losses in agriculture, with economic, ecological and social implications. Therefore, early detection of plant diseases and pests via automated methods are very important. Recent machine learning-based studies have become popular in the solution of agricultural problems such as plant diseases. In the current study, Averaging Ensemble and Majority Voting Ensemble PlantDiseaseNet models based on Convolutional Neural Network are developed by using a deep feature extraction approach based on pretrained deep networks. In the proposed model, we fine-tune and combine six state-of-art convolutional neural networks. Their evaluation is done both individually and as an ensemble. Finally, the performances of different combinations based on the proposed models are calculated using an SVM classifier. In order to verify the validity of the proposed model, a Turkey-PlantDataset containing disease and pest images obtained from the natural environment is employed. According to the obtained performance results, the accuracy scores are calculated as 97.56% using the Majority Voting Ensemble PlantDiseaseNet model and 96.83% using the Averaging Ensemble PlantDiseaseNet model. The results demonstrate that the proposed models reach or exceed state-of-the-art results for this problem.
